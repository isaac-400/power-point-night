* TODO What is steel?

* We make a lot of it

- 1.866 Gt globally in 2024 (up from 0.885Gt in 2000)
- Roughly 231 kg per person [fn:1]
- More than global Aluminium (0.069Gt) + Copper (0.023Gt) [fn:2]

* Pop Quiz: Where is all the steel!?
Steel is in a lot of stuff, but where is most of it?

Is it in:

1. Appliances? (washing machines, toasters, etc.)
2. Mechanical Equipment? (tools, cranes, heavy machinery, etc.)
3. Construction?
4. Cars and other transportation?

* Answers: Where is all the steel!?

#+begin_quote
1. Appliances? -> 2%
2. Mechanical Equipment? -> 19%
3. Construction? -> 52%
4. Cars and other transportation? -> 17%
#+end_quote

Wait... 52%? That seems pretty high!
If cars and trains and planes only use 17% where the heck is all the steel? Do I live in a steel box? Show me the hidden steel!!!!

* Tanget 1: Rebar
- Since the mid 19th century, we've been reinforing concrete with steel to make it better.[fn:3]
- Increased tensile strength
- Steel expands at a very similar rate to concrete.[fn:4]
- Now we can pour concrete into basically any shape and size

  We've been doing this a long time. Modern concrete is an awesome material: its cheap, moldable, durable and has excellent compressive strength. However, on its own it does not have great tensile strength. Adding steel reenforcement can help mitigate that.
  Steel and concrete have very close to the same coefficient of thermal expansion, so you don't get cracking when the structure heats up and cools.
  Steel and concrete are a perfect match! Look at how happy that guy is! He loves rebar too!

* Tanget 1: Rebar (cont.)
- Mostly carbon steel
- Not just steel: fiberglass, stainless steel, even bamboo![fn:5]

* Construction
- We use steel in other parts of construction too:
  - framing
  - cables
  - railroad tracks

* TODO The bad news
- Making steel takes a lot of energy (~20 GJ/ton)
